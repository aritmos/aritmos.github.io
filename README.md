## Documentation for [`sudoxu`](https://github.com/aritmos/sudoxu).

Currently hosted in my GitHub pages [here](https://aritmos.github.io/sudoxu-docs).

## ⚠️ Nightly+ ⚠️

This documentation is largely for my own use, and is constantly compiled during coding sessions.
It is not uncommon for pushes to be made to this repo ahead of any branch in the
[main repo](https://github.com/aritmos/sudoxu). For parity with the codebase clone the project's repo
and use `rustup` or `cargo doc` to compile the documentation manually.
